2. Install all the dependencies with npm install

3. Run the command `npx expo start`

4. Scan the QR code with your device (or use an emulator - for iOS it's via xCode) and have fun ðŸ˜„

## Repository Content

I created this repo to keep track of advancements of a React Native Tutorial I'm following.

[Here's the tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2j1yk-34OY&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hNTz3sxqGTfxAwU-DIHJd2) and all the rights of this repository goes to Net Ninja.

The only major change, when comparing with said tutorial, is that I'll be using Tailwind (NativeWind) for the project itself.

## Goal

The goal is to (eventually) create a mobile version of [LoopCost](https://loopcost.app)
